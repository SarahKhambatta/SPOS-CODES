The code you've provided appears to be written in Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET). To run this code from the command line, you'll need to compile it into an executable. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do that:

### 1. Install Visual Studio or the .NET SDK
Make sure you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine. You can download it from the [.NET official website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

### 2. Create a New VB.NET Project
1. **Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell** window.
2. **Create a new directory** for your project:
   ```bash
   mkdir CalculatorApp
   cd CalculatorApp
   ```
3. **Create a new VB.NET console application**:
   ```bash
   dotnet new console -n CalculatorApp
   cd CalculatorApp
   ```

### 3. Add Your Code
1. **Open the `Program.vb` file** located in the `CalculatorApp` directory using a text editor.
2. Replace the content with your module code, adding a `Main` subroutine to allow execution, like this:

   ```vb
   Imports System

   Module Calculator
       Public Function Add(n1 As Integer, n2 As Integer) As Integer
           Return n1 + n2
       End Function

       Public Function Subtract(n1 As Integer, n2 As Integer) As Integer
           Return n1 - n2
       End Function

       Public Function Multiply(n1 As Integer, n2 As Integer) As Integer
           Return n1 * n2
       End Function

       Public Function Divide(n1 As Integer, n2 As Integer) As Integer
           If n2 <> 0 Then
               Return n1 \ n2
           Else
               Console.WriteLine("Cannot divide by zero.")
               Return 0
           End If
       End Function

       Sub Main()
           ' Example usage of the calculator functions
           Console.WriteLine("Add: " & Add(5, 3))
           Console.WriteLine("Subtract: " & Subtract(5, 3))
           Console.WriteLine("Multiply: " & Multiply(5, 3))
           Console.WriteLine("Divide: " & Divide(5, 0)) ' This will show a message for division by zero
           Console.ReadLine() ' Wait for input before closing
       End Sub
   End Module
   ```

### 4. Build the Application
1. **Back in the command line**, make sure you’re in the `CalculatorApp` directory.
2. **Run the build command**:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

### 5. Run the Application
After a successful build, you can run the application:
```bash
dotnet run
```

### Notes:
- If you encounter any issues with the installation of the .NET SDK or the creation of the project, please let me know.
- The above example includes a simple way to demonstrate the calculator functions. You can modify the `Main` subroutine to take user input and perform operations dynamically if you wish.
